T1 and T2 are very large binary trees, with T1 much bigger than T2.
Create an algorithm to determine if T2 is a subtree of T1.

A tree T2 is a subtree of T1 if there exists a node N in T1 such that the subtree of N is identical to T2.
That is if you cut the tree at node N, the two trees would be identical.
