An animal shelter which holds only dogs and cats, operates on a strictly "First-In First-Out basis".
People must adopt either the "oldest"(based on animal arrival time) of all animals at the shelter, or
they can select whether they would prefer a dog or a cat (and will receive the oldest animal of that type).
They can not select which specific animal they would like. Create a data structures to  maintain this system
and implement operations such as enqueue, dequeueAny, DequeueDog, and DequeueCat.
You may use the built-in LinkedList data structure.
